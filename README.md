# rl-stealth 
This project is a Plugin for [Bakkesmod](https://bakkesmod.com/), which adds a new fun little game mode to use RocketLeague locally hosted games. All cars are either constantly invisble, or turn invisible, once they have enough boost. This mode is freely combinable with other boost related game modes, like "Drain" to make the game even more interesting. ðŸ˜‰
