# StealthPlugin
This project is a Plugin for [Bakkesmod](https://bakkesmod.com/), which adds a new fun little game mode to use in locally hosted Rocket League games. The boost range at which the cars turn invisible (default `[75-100]`) can be configured. This mode is freely combinable with other boost related game modes, like "Drainage" or "Boost Steal" to make the game even more interesting. ðŸ˜‰
